# DT162G Web Development with Javascript

## Assignment 3.3 - Client

In this assignment a client was created to show all courses that was stored in the database MongoDB. The client contacts the API to get the information that is stored in the database. A user can also create a course or delete an existing course.
The repository for the REST web service can be found here:

Since CSS wasn't in the requirements for the assignment I used this opportunity to test and play around with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), a CSS framework. Hence the multiple classes in each element.

Here is a link to the live client:
